    "document": "Oxygen evolution is the chemical process of generating elemental diatomic oxygen (O2) by a chemical reaction, usually from water, the most abundant oxide compound in the universe. Oxygen evolution on Earth is effected by biotic oxygenic photosynthesis, photodissociation, hydroelectrolysis, and thermal decomposition of various oxides and oxyacids. When relatively pure oxygen is required industrially, it is isolated by distilling liquefied air.\nNatural oxygen evolution is essential to the biological process of all complex life on Earth, as aerobic respiration has become the most important biochemical process of eukaryotic thermodynamics since eukaryotes evolved through symbiogenesis during the Proterozoic eon, and such consumption can only continue if oxygen is cyclically replenished by photosynthesis. The various oxygenation events during Earth's history had not only influenced changes in Earth's biosphere, but also significantly altered the atmospheric chemistry. The transition of Earth's atmosphere from an anoxic prebiotic reducing atmosphere high in methane and hydrogen sulfide to an oxidative atmosphere of which free nitrogen and oxygen make up 99% of the mole fractions, had led to major climate changes and caused numerous icehouse phenomena and global glaciations.\nIn industries, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a limiting factor in the process of generating molecular oxygen through chemical reactions such as water splitting and electrolysis, and improved OER electrocatalysis is the key to the advancement of a number of renewable energy technologies such as solar fuels, regenerative fuel cells and metal:air batteries.\nPhotosynthetic oxygen evolution is the fundamental process by which oxygen is generated in the earth's biosphere. The reaction is part of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of green algae and plants. It utilizes the energy of light to split a water molecule into its protons and electrons for photosynthesis. Free oxygen, generated as a by-product of this reaction, is released into the atmosphere.Water oxidation is catalyzed by a manganese-containing cofactor contained in photosystem II, known as the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) or the water-splitting complex. Manganese is an important cofactor, and calcium and chloride are also required for the reaction to occur. \nThe protons are released into the thylakoid lumen, thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient is the driving force for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis via photophosphorylation and the coupling of the absorption of light energy and the oxidation of water for the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis.\nIt was not until the end of the 18th century that Joseph Priestley accidentally discovered the ability of plants to \"restore\" air that had been \"injured\" by the burning of a candle. He followed up on the experiment by showing that air \"restored\" by vegetation was \"not at all inconvenient to a mouse.\" He was later awarded a medal for his discoveries that \"...no vegetable grows in vain... but cleanses and purifies our atmosphere.\" Priestley's experiments were further evaluated by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch physician, who then showed that the \"restoration\" of air only worked while in the presence of light and green plant parts.",
