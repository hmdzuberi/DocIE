Resellers present customers with a rebranded interface for deploying virtual machine instances, which are only billed for what their customers use. Cloud Harmony benchmarked the OrionVM Cloud Platform's InfiniBand-backed network storage as the world's fastest in 2011.\nThe company was founded and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia,\nwith offices in San Francisco, California.\nOrionVM was founded in a dorm by Sheng Yeo, Alex Sharp \nand Joseph Glanville in 2010. \nThe company's cloud platform was developed while the founders were still students at the University of Technology, Sydney and University of Sydney. After fifteen months of development, their cloud platform entered a Public Beta programme, with a full launch on 1 April 2011.\nIn 2011, the company received angel investments from Australian entrepreneur and PIPE Networks co-founder Stephen Baxter\nand American Gordon Bell of DEC and Microsoft Research.\nFor his work at OrionVM, CEO Sheng Yeo was nominated for the 2012 Australian Entrepreneur of the Year and the 2013 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.\nIn 2014, OrionVM received a State Merit award and a National Finalist nomination in the 2014 iAwards, with CTO Alex Sharp winning the Hills YIA Cloud award. The company was nominated for a Stevie Award for New Product or Service of the Year in Cloud Infrastructure Software, and an Australian Startup Awards nomination.\nIn 2016, Yeo and Sharp were named in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list.\nOrionVM sells a wholesale cloud infrastructure platform for public, private and hybrid cloud deployments. Vendors can white-label the platform for resale, or for internal use. Prominent resellers include:Australian telephone company AAPT\nBizCloud\nIT broker StrataCore.\nOrionVM uses the Xen hypervisor to virtualise multiple machines (referred to as \"instances\") on the same hardware. Linux instances use paravirtualisation for reduced overhead by default, with Windows Server being deployed using hardware-assisted virtualisation (HVM).Traditional virtual private server and infrastructure as a service providers consolidate storage into a storage area network, which is limited by Ethernet network speeds and best-effort reliability. OrionVM's platform took design cues from supercomputers by placing hypervisor storage and compute on the same physical servers. These are backed by a decentralised InfiniBand fabric. This improves network reliability and performance, and allows for rapid rollover between physical hosts for high availability.\nTo end users, the base of the platform consists of a web panel, where customers are able to deploy virtual machines. For resellers, the logos and theme can be modified to suit their own branding.From the panel, users can deploy preconfigured instances with their chosen operating system and required memory. Additional storage disks and IP addresses can be created separately, then assigned to new or existing instances. After shutting down, further resources can be allocated or scaled down.Instances can be accessed out-of-band via a web-based serial console or VNC session. Access is also available via ovm_ctl, an open source command line interface available from GitHub and the pip package manager.Linux machines come preconfigured with SSH, and Windows with RDP for remote access.\n",
