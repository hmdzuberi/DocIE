Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper The Age characterised him as \"A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity. René allows himself a few extended workouts and avoids the trap of repeating himself or overstating his case.\"\nHelsdingen has organized many successful tours, projects and festivals sponsored by NGOs, governmental institutions, companies to which he was responsible with regard to the control over the budgets made available.\n",
