This means that it highly relates to distributed systems / distributed computing where the distribution is global. The term also incorporates aspects of global software development and there outsourcing (when the outsourcing locations are globally distributed) and offshoring aspects. A specific aspect of global information systems is the case (domain) of global software development. A main research aspect in this field concerns the coordination of and collaboration between virtual teams. Further important aspects are the internationalization and language localization of system components.\nCritical tasks in designing global information systems are Process and system design: How are the processes between distributed actors organized, how are the systems distributed / integrated.\nTechnical architecture: What is the technical infrastructure enabling actors to collaborate?\nSupport mechanisms: How are actors in the process of communication, collaboration, and cooperation supported?\nA variety of examples can be given. Basically every multi-lingual website can be seen as a global information system. However, mostly the term GLIS is used to refer to a specific system developed or used in a global context.\n",
