    "document": "In engineering, master:slave is a relationship between two systems in which one controls the other. In some cases one master controls just one slave system, but in others there are multiple slave systems controlled by the same master. Sometimes the master is a different kind of system than the slave, but sometimes there are multiple similar systems and one of them is designated the master in order to centralize external (i.e. user) control of the collection.\nDue to its connection to slavery, the terminology is a subject of controversy and has been replaced with alternative terms in some cases.\nA master clock provides time signals used to synchronize one or more slave clocks as part of a clock network; a slave clock receives and displays the time from a master; though it may be able to keep time itself if the master is not working.A serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus typically has a single master controlling multiple slaves.\nI2C and I3C are also an example of master-slave technology.\nModbus uses a master device to initiate connection requests to slave devices.\nAn edge-triggered flip-flop can be created by arranging two gated latches in a master:slave configuration. It is so named because the master latch controls the slave latch's value and forces the slave latch to hold its value, as the slave latch always copies its new value from the master latch.\nIn photography, secondary, or slave, flash units are connected to a master unit to provide synchronized lighting.\nParallel audio duplication often entails multiple recording devices (i.e. for cassette tape or compact disc) linked together so that operating the controls of a master device triggers the same commands on slave devices.\nRailway locomotives operating in the same train (for example, to pull a load too heavy for a single locomotive) may be configured for master:slave operation with all but one of the locomotives controlled from the first. See Multiple-unit train control.\nIn a hydraulic system, a master cylinder is a control device that converts force into hydraulic pressure that drives movement in a slave cylinder at the other end of the hydraulic line. A common application is a vehicle brake system.\nThe term master is used in many technology contexts that do not refer to a relationship of control. Master may be used to mean a copy that has more significance than other copies in which case the term is an absolute concept; not a relationship. Sometimes the term master-slave is used in contexts that do not imply a controlling relationship.In database replication, the master database is the authoritative source. A replica database, sometimes called a slave, is synchronized to it but is not controlled by it.\nA Parallel ATA (aka IDE) hard drive interface supports two hard drives on a cable, which are designated master and slave. The distinction is required by the interface even though neither drive has control or priority over the other.\nThe master:slave terminology was first used in 1904. The terminology was used in 1988 for RFC 1059 and in 1997 for RFC 2136, related to the domain name system. In 2020, Paul Vixie commented on his choice of words:\nI introduced the master/slave terminology in RFC 2136, because I needed names for the roles in an AXFR/IXFR transaction, and the zone transfer hierarchy could be more than one layer deep, such that a server might initiate some AXFR/IXFR's to the \"primary master\" but then respond to AXFR/IXFR's from other servers. In retrospect I should have chosen the terms, \"transfer initiator\" and \"transfer responder\". However, the hydraulic brake and clutch systems in my car had \"master cylinders\" and \"slave cylinders\", and so I did not think I was either inventing a new use for the words \"master\" and \"slave\", or that my use of them for this purpose would be controversial.\nSaid hydraulic brakes for the automotive industry were patented in 1917 by Malcolm Loughead. The term slave cylinder was used in other patent applications, including one by Robert Esnault-Pelterie, published in 1919.\n",
